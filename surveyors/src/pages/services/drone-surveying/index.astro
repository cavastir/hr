// FAQ content
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What advantages does drone surveying offer over traditional methods?",
    answer: "Drone surveying offers several advantages: faster data collection covering large areas efficiently, reduced field time and associated costs, safe inspection of hazardous or difficult-to-access areas, minimal site disruption during surveys, rich visual documentation alongside technical data, and comprehensive rather than spot sampling of data points. While traditional methods remain valuable for certain applications, drones often provide a more efficient and comprehensive solution for many surveying needs."
  },
  {
    question: "How accurate are your drone surveys?",
    answer: "Our drone surveys typically achieve horizontal accuracies of 2-5cm and vertical accuracies of 3-10cm depending on flight parameters, ground control, and site conditions. For specialized applications requiring higher precision, we implement enhanced methodologies including RTK/PPK positioning and comprehensive ground control networks to achieve accuracies approaching traditional survey methods. All our deliverables include accuracy reports and quality assurance documentation."
  },
  {
    question: "What area can be covered in a typical drone survey?",
    answer: "A typical drone survey can cover 20-100 hectares per day depending on resolution requirements, terrain complexity, and weather conditions. Our high-endurance drones can survey larger areas efficiently, while complex sites requiring detailed documentation may progress at a slower pace to ensure data quality. We optimize flight planning based on project requirements to maximize efficiency while maintaining quality standards."
  },
  {
    question: "How do weather conditions affect drone surveying?",
    answer: "Weather significantly impacts drone operations. Surveys require dry conditions with winds below 25km/h, no precipitation, good visibility, and temperatures within the drone's operating range (typically 0-40Â°C). While light-to-moderate winds can be managed with professional equipment, rain, snow, fog, or strong winds will postpone operations for safety and data quality reasons. We monitor forecasts closely and schedule operations during optimal conditions."
  },
  {
    question: "What regulations apply to your drone operations?",
    answer: "All our drone operations comply with CASA (Civil Aviation Safety Authority) regulations. Our pilots hold CASA Remote Pilot Licenses (RePL), and our company maintains a Remote Operator Certificate (ReOC). We obtain all necessary approvals for controlled airspace operations, operations near airports, and other restricted areas. We carry comprehensive aviation liability insurance specific to drone operations and follow strict safety management procedures."
  },
  {
    question: "Can drone data integrate with BIM and CAD software?",
    answer: "Yes, our drone survey deliverables are specifically processed to integrate seamlessly with BIM and CAD platforms. Point clouds, mesh models, and orthophotos can be imported directly into software like Revit, AutoCAD Civil 3D, and Bentley applications. We provide data in industry-standard formats and can tailor outputs to specific software requirements, including coordinate system alignment and data structure organization to match your project workflows."
