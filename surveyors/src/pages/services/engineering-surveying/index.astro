// FAQ content
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What distinguishes engineering surveying from other surveying disciplines?",
    answer: "Engineering surveying specifically focuses on providing precise spatial information for the design, construction, and monitoring of infrastructure and built assets. It requires higher precision than many other surveying disciplines and integrates closely with engineering design processes. Engineering surveyors typically work with tighter tolerances, more specialized equipment, and have expertise in construction methodologies and engineering principles."
  },
  {
    question: "How accurate are your engineering surveys?",
    answer: "Our engineering surveys achieve positional accuracies ranging from ±2mm for high-precision structural monitoring to ±10mm for standard construction layout work. Vertical accuracies are typically ±1-5mm depending on project requirements. We use calibrated, high-precision instruments including robotic total stations, digital levels, and RTK GNSS systems, with rigorous quality control procedures to maintain these accuracies across projects of all sizes."
  },
  {
    question: "What types of projects require engineering surveying?",
    answer: "Engineering surveying is essential for infrastructure projects (roads, bridges, railways, tunnels), commercial and industrial building construction, mining operations, pipeline and utility design, dam and water management systems, renewable energy facilities, and any project requiring precise spatial positioning during design and construction. It's particularly crucial for projects with strict tolerance requirements, complex geometries, or where integration with existing infrastructure is needed."
  },
  {
    question: "How does engineering surveying support BIM and digital delivery?",
    answer: "Our engineering surveying services integrate seamlessly with Building Information Modeling (BIM) by providing accurate spatial data that forms the foundation of the digital model. We deliver point clouds, 3D models, and survey data in formats compatible with major BIM platforms, allowing for clash detection, 4D scheduling, and quantity takeoffs. Our surveyors also provide field verification during construction to ensure the physical project matches the digital twin."
  },
  {
    question: "What equipment do you use for engineering surveying?",
    answer: "We employ state-of-the-art equipment including Leica and Trimble robotic total stations with sub-second accuracy, digital and automatic levels, RTK GNSS receivers, 3D laser scanners capable of collecting millions of points per second, UAVs for aerial mapping, ground penetrating radar for subsurface investigation, and specialized monitoring equipment. All instruments are regularly calibrated and certified to maintain the highest standards of accuracy."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you approach quality assurance in engineering surveying?",
    answer: "Our quality assurance process includes instrument calibration verification, redundant measurements, closed traverses, independent checks of critical positions, statistical analysis of results, and comprehensive documentation of methodologies. We maintain detailed records of control networks and implement rigorous procedures to ensure consistency across multiple survey sessions and different team members. Our work is supervised by licensed surveyors with specific expertise in engineering applications."
