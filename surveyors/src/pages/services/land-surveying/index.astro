// FAQ content
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "Why do I need a land survey for my property?",
    answer: "A land survey provides essential information about your property's legal boundaries, easements, encroachments, and other features that may affect ownership rights. It's particularly important before buying or selling property, resolving boundary disputes, planning construction, or subdividing land to avoid costly legal issues and ensure compliance with regulations."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a typical boundary survey take?",
    answer: "The timeline for a boundary survey depends on property size, complexity, and research requirements. A standard residential boundary survey typically takes 1-2 weeks from engagement to delivery of final plans. Larger or more complex properties may require additional time, especially if extensive historical research is needed or if boundary conflicts are discovered."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between a boundary survey and a title survey?",
    answer: "A boundary survey focuses specifically on determining and marking property boundaries, while a title survey (sometimes called an identification survey) is more comprehensive, identifying boundaries, encroachments, easements, improvements, and other features affecting title. Title surveys are often required for property transactions or financing, while boundary surveys may be sufficient for fence installation or resolving specific boundary questions."
  },
  {
    question: "How accurate are your land surveys?",
    answer: "Our land surveys meet or exceed all regulatory standards for accuracy, typically achieving positional tolerances of ±10mm in urban areas and ±50mm in rural areas. We use state-of-the-art equipment and rigorous procedures to ensure reliable results, and all surveys are conducted or supervised by licensed surveyors in accordance with state regulations."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to be present during the survey?",
    answer: "While it's not mandatory for you to be present during the survey, we often recommend it, especially for boundary surveys. Your presence allows you to provide valuable information about property features and discuss any concerns directly with the surveyor. However, if you can't be present, we can proceed with the survey as long as we have proper access to the property."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle boundary disputes?",
    answer: "When boundary disputes arise, we conduct thorough research of historical records and precise field measurements to determine the legally correct boundary location. We document all findings clearly and can provide expert witness services if the dispute proceeds to litigation. Our goal is to provide objective, factual information that helps resolve disputes efficiently and accurately."
