    title: "UAV/Drone Surveying",
    icon: "uav",
    description: "Drone surveying has fundamentally changed how we approach data collection. By deploying advanced UAVs, we capture high-resolution aerial imagery and LiDAR data with unparalleled speed and safety. This technology allows us to survey large or inaccessible areas efficiently, providing a comprehensive overview for progress monitoring, volumetric calculations, and environmental assessments. The result is a richer dataset that empowers clients to make more informed decisions, faster."

    title: "3D Laser Scanning",
    icon: "laser",
    description: "When a project demands the highest level of detail, our 3D laser scanning services deliver. By capturing millions of data points in minutes, we create a precise digital twin of any structure or environment. This technology is indispensable for creating accurate as-built models, conducting detailed dilapidation reports, and preserving heritage sites. The resulting point cloud data provides an unambiguous record, enabling sophisticated analysis, clash detection, and design verification."
  },
  {
    title: "GPS/GNSS Systems",
    icon: "gps",
    description: "Our reliance on state-of-the-art GPS and GNSS technology ensures that every measurement is anchored in real-world accuracy. Utilizing multiple satellite constellations, we establish reliable, centimeter-level positioning for projects of any scale. This is the backbone of our field operations, critical for establishing robust site control, performing accurate construction set-outs, and conducting large-scale topographic surveys. The efficiency of RTK (Real-Time Kinematic) technology means we cover more ground without sacrificing precision."
  },
  {
    title: "Robotic Total Stations",
    icon: "level",
    description: "The robotic total station remains the workhorse of precision surveying for good reason. These instruments provide exceptional accuracy for tasks where every millimeter matters. They are the go-to tool for detailed structural monitoring, precise construction set-outs, and establishing fine control networks. By allowing a single surveyor to operate with high efficiency, they ensure that we can deliver meticulous results on schedule, forming a critical part of our integrated approach to surveying solutions."
